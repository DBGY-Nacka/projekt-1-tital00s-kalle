Product Hub Website

This is a webiste for a product shopping company. The purpose is to explore how a webiste can be made
pleasing for the customer that feels trustworthy. 

Many websites can be overwhelming and diffucult to understand because of a bad GUI.
Therefor we have made a simple, yet effective website.

It's developed using html, javascript and css to style the webiste. Combined with python and flask as the framework.

A database is created using SQLite. Each product is stored in the database with the following information:

Product ID: Specifies each product with a unique number
Name: Product Name
Description: Product description
Price: Product Price, used to sort
Inventory Count: Ammount in stock
Color: Color, used to sort
Category: Used to sort by category
Rating: Customer rating
Image: Image for each product

Libraries required:
flask
sqlite3

If you want view the database, either download DB Browser (SQLite) or download the SQLite Viewer extension.

To run the code, simply run app.py. Then follow the given local host link to view the website.
