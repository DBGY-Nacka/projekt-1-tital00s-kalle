Product Hub Webiste

This is a webiste for a product shopping company. The purpose is to create a website that feels trustworthy, 
and also is pleasing for each customer. Many of us experience that some webistes are difficult to 
navigate trough. Therefor we have made a simple yet effective website.

It is developed using html, javascript and css to style the webiste. Combined with python and flask as the framework.

A database is created using SQLite. Each product is stored in the database with the following information:

Product ID: Specifies each product with a unique number
Name: Product Name
Description: Product description
Price: Product Price, used to sort
Inventory Count: Ammount in stock
Color: Color, used to sort
Category: Used to sort by category
Rating: Customer rating
Image: Image for each product

Libraries needed to download:

To run the code, simply run app.py. Then follow the given local host link to view the website.
